AUNotes is a basic AudioUnit plugin designed for keeping text notes alongside an arrangement.  Since Logic Pro does not allow you to have per-channel text notes like some other sequencers, this plugin provides a quick way for you to store extra information in your Logic documents.

To use, simply instantiate the plugin in the desired channel in your arrangement, and type away.  Your changes will be saved automatically when you save your document.
